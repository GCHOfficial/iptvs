/// Live-stream mpv network/demuxer tuning: no on-disk cache (IPTV streams don't
/// benefit from one, and it can fail on restricted temp/cache paths), a short
/// network timeout, and transparent reconnect on transient HTTP drops. Shared by
/// the fullscreen player and the live preview player so both get the same
/// resilience.
///
/// **`reconnect_streamed=0`, deliberately.** FFmpeg's in-place reconnect
/// cannot help a live IPTV stream and actively harms it. Providers answer with
/// a close-delimited body, so *every* end of stream looks "premature" to
/// FFmpeg, and it reconnects to the **post-redirect** URL — whose
/// per-connection token a portal has already spent, so the retry is refused
/// and the demuxer sits there retrying a URL that can never work again. Where
/// it does reconnect, on a provider that front-loads a backlog, it splices
/// *older* content in: the audio timestamps reset and A/V desyncs (reproduced
/// locally). Live recovery belongs to the app's own watchdog, which
/// **re-resolves** first and so comes back with a fresh token. `reconnect=1`
/// stays on: it still covers a connection that drops mid-body with a known
/// content length, which is the case FFmpeg's retry is actually good at.
///
/// `reconnect_at_eof` must stay out of `stream-lavf-o`: an HLS live stream's
/// manifest is a *finite* HTTP resource, and with that flag ffmpeg (verified on
/// FFmpeg 8 / mpv 0.41) treats its EOF as an error and reconnects forever, so
/// the demuxer probe never completes and the stream never opens at all. A clean
/// server-side end-of-stream on an infinite TS instead surfaces as mpv
/// `eof-reached`, which media_kit maps to `completed=true` *and*
/// `buffering=false` — so the buffering-gated stall watchdog can't see it. The
/// embedded/Windows path therefore treats a *live* `completed` as a drop and
/// reconnects (the `stream.completed` listener in `player_screen.dart`,
/// `shouldReconnectOnCompleted`); the Linux-native path gets the equivalent
/// `end-file` eof/error drop over IPC (`LinuxNativePlaybackSignal.dropped`).
